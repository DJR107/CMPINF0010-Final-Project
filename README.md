# Analyzing our data
To most accurately make use of the Pittsburgh neighborhood crime data, we are going to use a similar method of analysis to the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2018-crime-statistics) (who knows better than them?)

>The UCR [Uniform Crime Reporting] Program collects information on crimes reported by law enforcement agencies regarding the violent crimes of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, as well as the property crimes of burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson. (The FBI classifies arson as a property crime, but does not estimate arson data because of variations in the level of participation by the reporting agencies. Consequently, arson data is not included in the property crime estimate.) The program also collects arrest data for the offenses listed above plus 20 offenses that include all other crimes except traffic violations.
